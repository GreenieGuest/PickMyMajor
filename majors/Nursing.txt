[[Nursing]]
This is an undergraduate major that is the prerequisite to becoming a Registered Nurse(RN) offered as a nursing program. Nursing majors study subjects like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and they get hands-on experience through clinicals.
Once you complete a BSN program and pass your NCLEX-RN exam, you qualify for an RN license. Nursing majors can also pursue non-clinical roles such as an educator or a nurse manager. Nursing specialties include ER nursing, Surgical nursing, Critical Care nursing, Oncology nursing, and more.
